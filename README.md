# AdventureWorksSalesDashboard
<p>This repository contains an interactive business dashboard built with Power BI, showcasing key performance metrics across multiple business areas. This project was developed as part of the Maven Analytics Power BI course and demonstrates a comprehensive approach to data analysis, visualization, and user interactivity.</p>

<h3>üìù Project Overview</h3>
<p>The goal of this project is to transform the AdventureWorks company's raw data into a structured, actionable dashboard that supports decision-making processes. The dashboard is designed to provide stakeholders with a clear overview of the company's performance in sales, profitability, and customer demographics, and to enable them to drill down into more detailed insights.</p>

<h3>üìà Key Features</h3>
<h4>1. Dynamic Dashboard Design</h4>
<p>Intuitive Layout: A clean and organized layout guides users through the key metrics and insights, making navigation easy and efficient.<br>
Drill-down Capabilities: Users can explore data at different levels (e.g., product category, customer segment, regional sales) to gain detailed insights.</p>
<h4>2. Advanced Visualizations and KPIs</h4>
<p>Visual Elements: The dashboard includes bar charts, line graphs, pie charts, and custom KPIs to present data trends clearly and effectively.<br>
KPIs: Track important metrics like year-over-year growth, profit margins, and regional performance.</p>
<h4>3. Data Transformation and Modeling</h4>
<p>Data Cleaning: Used Power Query to clean and transform raw data, ensuring accuracy and consistency across all visualizations.<br>
Data Model: Created relationships between tables to optimize the performance and enhance the accuracy of insights.</p>
<h4>4. Custom DAX Measures</h4>
<p>Built advanced DAX measures. These custom measures allow for deeper insights and trend analysis across different dimensions.</p>
<h4>5. User Interactivity</h4>
<p>Slicers and Filters: Time-period slicers, region filters, and customer segmentation filters were added to provide stakeholders the flexibility to view data according to specific needs.<br>
Dynamic Tooltips: Tooltips display detailed information on each metric, giving users additional context without overwhelming the dashboard layout.</p>
